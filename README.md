### Homework Instructions
1. Create a new project;
2. Write Verilog source files (module and testbench), description of the multiplexer as shown below using case statements. Saved the Verilog description as q2_xxxxxxx.v, and q2_tb_xxxxxxx.v;
3. The specifications of the multiplexer are:
  - The circuit is a 4-to-1 multiplexer;
  - The inputs A, B, C, D and output X are all 2-bit vectors;
  - Output X will be equal to either one of the 4 inputs depending on the 4 combinations of 2-bits signal SEL. The following True-table details the relationship between SEL and output X;
